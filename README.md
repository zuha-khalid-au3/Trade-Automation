### Automated Trading System using JavaScript and Node.js

**Description:**
Built an automated trading system using JavaScript and Node.js. The system automatically runs, places trades, and executes them for a specified number of times as requested by the user.

**Technical Skills:**
- **Language:** JavaScript
- **Framework:** Node.js
- **IDE Compatibility:** Can be run on any local or online IDE. Preferably used with REPL.
- **Brokerage Platform:** Utilizes Upstox API for free brokerage via API calls.

**Project Details:**
The purpose of this project is to leverage my keen interest in automated trading, which I've had since the beginning of my career. Additionally, I aim to utilize my savings to clear my Scaler EMI.

**Trading Strategies:**
The system follows price action and trends, placing trades based on candlestick analysis.

**Unique Feature:**
Trades can be executed automatically in an open market environment.

**Risk Management:**
The system automatically closes all trades once they hit the stop-loss threshold.

**Result and Achievement:**
Achieved a 15% return with a capital of just 4.7K in approximately 20 minutes.

**Continuous Learning and Improvement Challenges:**
Faced multiple challenges during system development. Implemented synchronous methods like promises to handle rapid price movements. Continuously learning and improving, with a focus on integrating signals like MACD, SMA, and SMEN into the algorithm.

**Future Prospects:**
Currently, the project is implemented using backend code only. Future plans include building a simple UI for easier input and logic handling. Also exploring further trading signals for algorithm enhancement.

**Phases of the Project:**
1. **Order Placement:** Initially, simple buy orders are placed at the user-defined price, automatically executing upon reaching the specified selling price.
2. **Optimization:** The system is optimized to run continuously until the specified number of orders is reached, waiting for each trade to complete before proceeding.
3. **Risk Management Implementation:** Implements risk management by closing all trades if the Profit and Loss (PNL) hits a predefined limit.
4. **Advanced Trading Techniques:** Currently working on integrating OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data for candlestick analysis to improve trading decisions.
5. **Testing and Deployment:** All phases are tested on indexes like Bank Nifty, Nifty, and Sensex. A custom selection process guides users in obtaining the instrument key required for trading.
